            <p id="whiteHutText2"><span class="blue">What is a surfing summer camp and why is it a great idea for children?</span><br><br>
                Summer camps are first and foremost and excellent way to keep the kids entertained and active outdoors during the summer months. They are also a chance for your child to 
                practice surfing multiple times in a concentrated period so that they can gain the skills to become confident and competent surfers.<br><br>
                The program for the half day camp involves 1 surf per day and the full day camp 2 surfs per day. Each surf lasts generally around 1.5 hours each session, then the time outside the water is spent teaching the children about rip tides, ocean currents, general water safety, surfing techniques, balance, surfing etiquette, and environmental awareness. We also play fun games with them to help improve coordination, balance and team work.
